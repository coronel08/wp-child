<p>I am going to go into a couple of details on how I like to setup a website for personal sites,  businesses, and E-Commerce. There are many ways to setup a website but I typically like using Wordpress, so this article will focus on getting Wordpress up and running. You are going to need a few things to get a website going and I will focus on what I believe to be the best path. Wordpress requires a Database, Webserver, and PHP programming language installed, also known as a technology stack. </p>

<h2>Why Wordpress?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a fan of free, you can't get any better than FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). Wordpress is a completely free and will always be free. The software is&nbsp;<strong>free</strong>&nbsp;to download and&nbsp;<strong>free</strong>&nbsp;to use in any way you want to, we just have to learn how to set it up and use it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You could run Wordpress on an old spare computer(FREE!), a RaspberryPi(FREE!), or a server/cloud($50-$90) and get a completely solid website for yourself with a little know how. By the end of this article you should be able to deploy it on any of these options.</p>

<p>I recommend Wordpress over competitors such as Wix, SquareSpace, and pretty much everything else out there. Wix and SquareSpace can only be used and hosted on their own websites and are not opensource. Wordpress has an extensive amount of plugins to help get things done and developers are abundant if you ever want to develop something serious. </p>

<p>I usually ask customers what they have in mind for a website and they usually reply with "Oh I was just going to use GoDaddy". Yeah, you shouldn't use GoDaddy for anything ever and while we are at it you shouldn't use any of these as well. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://researchasahobby.com/full-list-eig-hosting-companies-brands/" target="_blank">A FULL LIST OF EIG COMPANIES TO AVOID WHILE AVOIDING GODADDY</a> and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/dwa8p8/godaddy_avoid_like_the_plague/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REDDIT HORROR STORY on SUPPORT</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Servers? </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A server is just a computer so there is nothing to be confused about.  I start with the self hosting option because it is free, the link section will have a tutorial on setting up the stack on it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A paid server will have the technology stack already installed and usually offer 1 click or easy installs for Wordpress. The link will have the companies pricing chart for web hosting.  I like using these hosts personally. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I Think Veerotech has great support, standard pricing, and lots of features so I usually recommend that.</p>
